                        The Bikar was my Year-End-Project for one of my high school's engineering courses. It is a
                        fully-electric go-kart with front and rear suspension, independent motor control, and is made
                        from deconstructed bicycles, electronic components, and a square tube (mild steel) chassis. 
                        It won 1st place in my school system's annual technology fair, and was a big hit throughout
                        the school.

                        Never having made a vehicle before, I first had to learn about all the different systems that vehicles
                        have to make them go. After the initial research, I began thinking of designs and planning out the
                        construction phases. Once I felt content with the plans, I began the construction process and worked my 
                        way through to the final product. I completed the project with a presentation displaying the process,
                        which you can view

                        With a project this big, there was a lot to learn. As for technical skills, I learned a 
                        great deal of basic metalworking, how to work with circuitry, how to weld, and project management.
                        I learned about steering, suspension, and motor-control systems, as well as the basics of vehicle design.
                        During this project I began to realize the importance of patience and perseverence, and I consolidated 
                        my love for engineering as a whole.

                        I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent on this project, and while there are many things I would like to 
                        improve about The Bikar, I have carried the skills and lessons with me and have applied them in various 
                        other projects.
